				<p>I’m one of the several people in the US who can never give you a straight answer when you ask where they’re from – I was born in Hong Kong, grew up in Shanghai, but regularly visited family in the Bay Area, where I am now located for college. Both my parents speak Cantonese, yet I only ever learned to speak Mandarin, which has been getting rusty anyways. To toss some quick facts out there:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I spent much of high school trying to spread Ultimate Frisbee throughout Shanghai and nearly skipped my graduation ceremony to attend a tournament final</li>
					<li>I grew up loving all types of cars, but never got to drive until I permanently moved to the US</li>
					<li>I’ve spent half a day lining up at grand openings of major boba stores, simply because</li>
					<li>I love chatting about ethical issues/implications revolving around cutting-edge technologies</li>
